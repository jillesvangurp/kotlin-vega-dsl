## Development status & goals

This is a project that is **under construction**. I'm using it for a project and adding features as I go and my intention is certainly not to cover the full feature set of vega.

I'll update the README once this changes but I'm not looking for a lot of active contributions and I may change this quite a bit for now.

Even though this supports only the bare minimum of Vega features currently, the main point is that it uses [json-dsl](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/json-dsl), which makes it really easy to add stuff to the Json via raw json string literals, manipulating the underlying map, and using e.g. lists or maps in Kotlin. Proper model classes may be added and expanded over time on a need to have basis. But it's useful to me even before I do that.
